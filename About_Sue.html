                <p style="padding-top: 0pt; " class="paragraph_style">Sue Wallis lived in Shoreham and was well known as a designer, teacher and creator of stained glass.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">Sue spent several years in Graphic Design before moving into the area of stained glass, which proved to be her forte. From 1988 to 1990, she undertook a two year course at Northbrook College, Worthing, studying stained glass. This was followed from 1990 to 1993 by a three‑year course at Swansea, focusing on architectural stained glass in which she achieved distinctions in all areas.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">Sue believed that the Swansea course was fundamental to the understanding of the true potential of the subject. The course had been in existence for nearly sixty years and had established itself as a centre of excellence for training and education in the field of decorative glass in architecture. The programme maintained the link with architecture, training students in traditional craft processes such as glass painting, lead glazing and cartoon drawing, in addition to more contemporary approaches such as glass casting, sandblasting and acid etching.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">While at Swansea, Sue Wallis completed one commission locally, at Norton, Mumbles, where she produced a series of three lancet windows for a Community Hall and place of worship, plus several domestic commissions.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">After she graduated from Swansea, Sue was invited to exhibit at the New Designers Exhibition, in the Design Centre at Islington. Later that year, in August 1993, she worked with Patrick Reyntiens OBE on a Master class course at Swansea. Reyntiens had been responsible for the interpretation and execution of the late John Piper's glass designs, as well as being a stained glass artist in his own right.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">Her style encapsulates all that is best from the traditional stained glass that is the glory of so many churches, but she also used modem techniques and approaches. In this way she was able to utilise techniques such as casting and fusing to sandblasting and acid etching, to find the most appropriate technique for the project in hand. The pleasure, dedication and enjoyment of the whole spectrum of glass design manifests itself in every piece of work that she produced.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">In addition to her glass, Sue worked as a part time Art technician at St. Andrews Boys High School, Worthing and the areas in which she worked include painting, ceramics and mosaics<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">St. Andrews had a very successful Art department and as technician Sue was involved in various activities and projects, these have included working with Artist in Residence and leading workshop activities with students.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">1999 – Mosaic Workshop with Brighton artist, Rob Demal to produce large panel for external display.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">2000 – Millennium Tapestry Workshop led by Worthing artist Jane Brunning to produce wall hanging for school foyer. (This was exhibited at Dome, London).<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">2004 – Mosaic Project, Springfield School, Worthing. To produce a 2-metre square panel designed and made by the pupils.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">2010 – Mosaic Project, Colgate Primary School, Horsham. To produce a 2-metre square panel designed and made by the pupils.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">As part of her work at St. Andrews, Sue produced educational resources for Teaching and Learning, which were used for inset workshops across the county. These resources have included Mixed Media, Print, Ceramic relief, Ceramic Slip design, Sculpture and video material to promote effective practice in West Sussex. <br /></p>
